1. Choose two buffers, let say pH1 = 7.00 and pH2 = 4.00 and measure the corresponding E1 and E2 (in mV).
2. For a sample with pHx, you measure Ex.
3. Calculate pHx = pH1 + (Ex – E1)(pH2 – pH1)/(E2-E1)
Important notes:
- all buffers and samples must be measured at the same temperature
- use a stabilisation time of about 1 minute for the electrode response
- the instrument must have a very high impedance (500 Gohm, not used in common voltmeters; use a pH/mV-meter in "mV" mode to test the equation)
- use a 3rd known buffer as sample (e.g., pH= 9.00 or 10.00) to verify if the sensor response is linear).
- at pH=7.00 , the common measured E is not zero; in the given equation, (Ex – E1) is the correction for this asymmetry
- in the given equation, (pH2 – pH1)/(E2-E1) is the electrode slope.



// 2,67 volt short circuit
pHx = 7 + (Ex – 2.67)(4 – 7)/(E2-2.67)



x = 7 + (y – 251)(4 – 7)/(284-251)


slope: (pH2 – pH1)/(E2-E1)




x = 7 + (y – 2.51)(4 – 7)/(3.01-2.51)
